## 6. Closing Thoughts

To wrap up, CRediT's future will not occur in a vacuum. There are a host
of other standards and processes that will be tightly integrated with
its successful adoption. Metadata schemas such as JATS, along with tools
like ORCID and Rescognito are making it possible to implement, and
publishers have also begun to drive productive uptake in manuscript
submission workflows. As standards and practices coalesce around this
promising taxonomy at scale, then the promise of acknowledging creative
scholarly activity with greater granularity can be realized, and it will
almost certainly be a boon to research integrity and other facets of
scholarly communication.
