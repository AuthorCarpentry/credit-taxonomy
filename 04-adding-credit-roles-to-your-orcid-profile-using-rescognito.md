## 5. Adding CRediT Roles to your ORCiD profile using Rescognito

If you want to try applying the CRediT Taxonomy to your own work in a
public way, here are the ingredients you will need to give the
Rescognito tool a shot. You must have handy:

1.  A paper or dataset with a DOI that features the ORCID numbers for
    those to be credited

2.  Some thought toward the CRediT roles performed per co-author for
    that item

3.  An ORCiD profile for each contributor to be credited

(Without these, you may want to watch Richard Wynne's demo linked on the
Rescognito page.)

Steps:

1.  Log in to your ORCiD profile and make sure the article you would
    like to update is already listed.

2.  From the [[Rescognito home
    page]{.underline}](https://rescognito.com/), either:

    a.  From the search box, search for either:

        i.  Your name

        ii. Your ORCiD number

        iii. The article's title

> If using name or ORCiD number, navigate to your ORCiD record to the
> article (which must be already listed there).

b.  Alternatively, add the DOI proper (starting with "10." and not the
    full DOI URL) to the rescognito.com URL

    i.  Example: "rescognito.com/10.6084/m9.figshare.8141783"

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
3.  With the article in the main pane, use the Reasons drop-down to
    select up to 5 CRediT roles per contributor per paper.

4.  Next, you will be prompted to sign in to your ORCiD profile, so
    complete that step.

5.  Within Rescognito, the roles should show in the main pane now for
    the article. To push these to your ORCiD profile, go to the My
    Settings button on the upper right above the article details and
    check the option as shown in the graphic below to "Please update my
    ORCiD record with CRediT recognitions."

6.  Turning back to your ORCiD profile, your Rescognito updates will
    push to the profile as a second source, which you may activate there
    in ORCiD to reveal the specific CRediT roles.
