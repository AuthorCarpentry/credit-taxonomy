## 1. What is CRediT?

What is an author? In academic publishing, it often takes many hands to
produce a work, which may involve much more than putting words on a
page; it could also include aspects like securing project funding or
writing code for analyzing data.

CRediT ("Contributor Roles Taxonomy") is a taxonomy used to attribute
authorship in scientific research. The taxonomy consists of 14 specific
roles to represent the variety of contributions that may apply within a
research and writing process.

In practice, CRediT is a controlled vocabulary for specific author
contributions. When CRediT is applied to a work, the work will have an
authorship list based upon these contributor roles.

The objective of these roles is to create an authorship ecosystem where
there is increased transparency for the many contributions that are put
forth in creating a publication. However, the CRediT taxonomy does not
attempt to prescribe what activities rise to the level of authorship.
Instead, it seeks to clearly define the contributions of each author.

The 14 roles are defined below. Please note that the language below is
copied from [[NISO]{.underline}](https://credit.niso.org/), which
maintains the taxonomy as a standard.

> Conceptualization:\
> Ideas; formulation or evolution of overarching research goals and
> aims.
>
> Data Curation:
>
> Management activities to annotate (produce metadata), scrub data and
> maintain research data (including software code, where it is necessary
> for interpreting the data itself) for initial use and later re-use.
>
> Formal Analysis:
>
> Application of statistical, mathematical, computational, or other
> formal techniques to analyze or synthesize study data.
>
> Funding Acquisition:
>
> Acquisition of the financial support for the project leading to this
> publication.
>
> Investigation:
>
> Conducting a research and investigation process, specifically
> performing the experiments, or data/evidence collection.
>
> Methodology:
>
> Development or design of methodology; creation of models.
>
> Project Administration:
>
> Management and coordination responsibility for the research activity
> planning and execution.
>
> Resources:
>
> Provision of study materials, reagents, materials, patients,
> laboratory samples, animals, instrumentation, computing resources, or
> other analysis tools.
>
> Software:
>
> Programming, software development; designing computer programs;
> implementation of the computer code and supporting algorithms; testing
> of existing code components.
>
> Supervision:
>
> Oversight and leadership responsibility for the research activity
> planning and execution, including mentorship external to the core
> team.
>
> Validation:
>
> Verification, whether as a part of the activity or separate, of the
> overall replication/reproducibility of results/experiments and other
> research outputs.
>
> Visualization:
>
> Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work,
> specifically visualization/data presentation.
>
> Writing -- Original Draft:
>
> Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work,
> specifically writing the initial draft (including substantive
> translation).
>
> Writing -- Review & Editing:
>
> Preparation, creation and/or presentation of the published work by
> those from the original research group, specifically critical review,
> commentary or revision -- including pre- or post-publication stages.

Without CRediT, authorship attribution often requires an actual writing
contribution to the drafts and sections of the paper. This model was
seen (for example, Holcombe 2019) as out-of-date for works with massive
author-lists, and also did not encourage the progress of scientific
collaboration and discovery across disciplines. For instance, a
collaborator with key methodological contributions to a project would
not receive the core academic incentive of authorship without the
working field knowledge to effectively contribute to the writing
component of the project. Subsequently, that researcher would not add
value to their research portfolio through citations of that work,
despite having contributed time and expertise toward its completion.

CRediT was established through a 2014 *Nature* paper ([["Publishing:
Credit where credit is
due"]{.underline}](https://doi.org/10.1038/508312a)) that describes the
survey of authors used to develop and justify the taxonomy and its 14
roles. Since then, CRediT has been adopted as an attribution standard by
many journals and presses, including PLoS, Cell Press, and a number of
university presses. The standard has outlined an XML schema, making the
taxonomy machine readable. This is incorporated into some journal
management systems and can also be implemented manually. In addition,
CRediT has been integrated with ORCiD profiles, enabling researchers to
outline their contributions on their profile using a tool called
Rescognito.
