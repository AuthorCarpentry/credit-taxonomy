## 3. Applying the CRediT Taxonomy 

If you are completing this lesson in a group, please discuss the
following scenarios in small groups and respond to the discussion
questions below.

If you are completing this lesson individually, please consider the
following scenarios and the related discussion questions. It may be a
valuable exercise to assume the perspective of one or more of the
individuals involved in the scenarios and list salient points from their
perspectives.

-   What is your initial impression of the event described?

-   How would you suggest the parties in each scenario handle the
    conflict?

-   What contributor roles from the CRediT taxonomy (if any) apply to
    the different individuals in these scenarios?

-   Could the CRediT Taxonomy be used by groups to determine authorship
    even when it is not a requirement in the journal?

Scenarios:

1.  An undergraduate student has been hired to code video data for a
    project. The student puts in considerable time and effort to code
    this project. A paper is being submitted using this coding that the
    student has done. There has been no mention of offering
    co-authorship to this student.

2.  A junior grad student has been advised that one of their first
    projects would be to help a postdoc to complete some data collection
    and analyses for a paper. The junior grad student is told in passing
    by the postdoc that maybe they will get to be a co-author if any of
    the work is decent.

3.  A recent Ph.D. graduate discovers figures and data directly from one
    of their thesis chapters published in a recent article by a faculty
    member. The recent graduate was not acknowledged at all in the
    paper. The recent graduate contacts the faculty member to ask about
    the work. The faculty member says they've done nothing wrong as
    those figures were generated from data partially gathered in the
    faculty member's lab.

4.  A paper with 4 co-authors is being published in a journal that
    requires data to be made publicly available in a repository. The
    first author says they will take care of placing the data in the
    repository associated with their home institution. A year or so
    later, the 2nd author is pursuing GoogleScholar and discovers the
    first author has considerably more citations for a work that looks
    somewhat familiar. Digging in further they discover that the work is
    the dataset that was put together by multiple members of the author
    team, but only had the first author listed in the recommended
    citation for the dataset.

5.  A faculty member is advising a graduate student in preparing their
    first paper for publication. Going through various drafts, the
    graduate student notices an unfamiliar name is added to the author
    line. The graduate student asks the advisor about the added name.
    The advisor replies that this is a long-time colleague who has
    helped the lab immensely, so they are appropriate to add as a
    co-author.
