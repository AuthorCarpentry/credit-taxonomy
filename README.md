Author Carpentry : Using CRediT (Contributor Roles Taxonomy) for Authorship Attribution
=======

CRediT (“Contributor Roles Taxonomy”) is a taxonomy used to attribute authorship in scientific research. The taxonomy consists of 14 specific roles to represent the variety of contributions that may apply within a research and writing process. In practice, CRediT is a controlled vocabulary for specific author contributions. When CRediT is applied to a work, the work will have an authorship list based upon these contributor roles. This lesson introduces the roles and engages participants in activities that foster familiarity with the roles as well as critical thinking about their use.
